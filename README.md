 Shows the Stratton mountain, Vermont ski area. This site is heavily developed but experienced much less flood damage than did the Okemo ski resort at Ludlow. A few reasons are obvious - little to no development along and in the river corridor, and over 100 condiminuums rather than individual units. 
Learning if Stratton did have a storm water runoff program in place would be interesting.
